* New multi-threaded physics engine fully separates physics from the game tick (ie even gigantic ships will not create any tick lag)
* Dramatically improved physics performance, with ships up to 500,000 blocks large causing only minor lag
* Added Sponge compatibility
* Added '/vw tps' command to see physics tick rate
* Added smooth ship interpolation to the client, similar to what vanilla boats use
* Improved client performance dramatically by removing unnecessary code
* Completely redesigned the pilots chair
* Fixed issues with Flans mod
* Added support for the Simple Teleporters mod
* Fixed the lighting bugs
* Made physics collision push only, no pull collisions to get ships stuck in the ground
* Fixed bug that gave players infinite block reach distance
* Players in survival mode are no longer "kicked for flying", they are however still kicked for moving too quickly; perhaps that can be fixed by next update
* Disabled ship explosion forces for now
* Jars are now signed with a secret key
