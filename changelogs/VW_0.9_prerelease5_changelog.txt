* New multi-threaded physics engine
* Dramatically improved physics performance, with ships up to 500,000 blocks large only causing minor lag
* Added Sponge compatibility
* Added '/vw tps' command to see physics tick rate
* Added smooth ship interpolation to the client, similar to what vanilla boats use
* Improved client performance dramatically by removing unnecessary code
* Redesigned the pilots chair
* Fixed issues with Flans mod
* Fixed the lighting bugs
* Made physics collision push only, no pull collisions to get ships stuck in the ground
* Players in survival mode are no longer "kicked for flying", they are however still kicked for moving too quickly; perhaps that can be fixed by next update
